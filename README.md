# Scribd-Viewer

Scribd-Viewer (previously known as Scribd-Bypass) is a Python/JavaScript program designed to help users access Scribd document files for educational purposes in a user-friendly manner.

# Project Status
Currently in progress of adding JavaScript version to enable seamless use via Web, however still figuring out on html forms and JavaScript connection

# How does it work?

### How normal Scribd document link looks like:

```
https://www.scribd.com/document/{document_id}/{document_title}
```

### What does the program do?

- It extracts the document ID from the provided link.
- It builds a unique URL to access the document.
- Copy the unique URL created and paste it into the user's clipboard.
- The program will then ask the user if they want the program to open the unique URL in their default web browser.

# Sneak Peek:
